# Week 05

## TUE 19-10-2022
Progress made:
- [x] None

Things to discuss:
- [ ] difference between p and u.
   - [ ] How to actually write the proof. 
   - [ ] If our solver doesn't know the constraint IDs how do we emmit something that uses them?

Notes:
- Output not of all variables that didn't work 
- then put a u step whenever you backtrack with the not of x_[1,1]=1 + x_[2,2]=2 + x_[3,3]=3  >= 1, atleast one of the settings is wrong.
