# Meeting 02
_Meeting not held, very brief chat as I don't know how to read an email. :)_

## TUE 2022-09-27
Things to Discuss:
- Went through the VeriPB codebase and ran some of the tests instances. (opb files are the program as psudo-boolean constraints, obp files are the proofs)
- Went through the tutorial slides and tried to work out the examples.
- Tried to read the papers associated with GSI and GCS but didn't get far.
- A little confused on how to write my own proofs and how to approach it.
    - Went throught the tutorial slides and tried to work out the examples.
    - Should I be working with the Glasgow Subgraph isomorphism codebase or Glasgow Constraint solver codebase?
        - Ciaran said he'd send me some examples of proof logs and how to write them manually from scratch.
    - Any advice on better understanding whats written on the opb files and the different commands?
        - Proofs will be sent!

Things before next meeting:
- Read the proofs sent by Ciaran.
- Try to get the GCS instance working and try to understand the proofs of the examples.
- Try to write some proofs manually from scratch.
