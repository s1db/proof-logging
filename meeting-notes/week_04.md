# Week 04

## WED 13-10-2021
Things I had to do:
- [x] Work on the sudoku solver proof generator.

What I have done:
- [x] Got the model from the certified constraint solver paper code.
- [x] Went over Jakob's talk(first 1.5 parts) at Simons Institute.
    - Had a good overview of psuedo-boolean reasoning.
    - Described how RUP works.

- Arc consistency on equalities is NP-Hard
- RUP is from SAT, it is generalised arc consistency on CNF.
- backtrack follows from RUP.
- cutting planes come in when more clever stuff is used.
